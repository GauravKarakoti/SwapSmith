## 🛠️ Development Workflow

    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/swapsmith.git](https://github.com/your-username/swapsmith.git)
    cd swapsmith
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    We use `npm` for package management. Install the required packages:

    ```

3.  **Environment Setup**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the example provided:
